1. To install all the dependency packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. The api folder is the django app which contains the REST API views for 
fetching the youtube data from the database

3. The video collector has the scheduler 
    -> collectvideos.py, contains a function that collect all the youtube 
    data based on the predefined search and store the new records alone in 
    the dayabase. I have used "youtube-data-api==0.0.20" python package
        Note: Kindly replace the "api_key" 
    -> scheduler.py, has a function that is scheduled to run the the 
    function in collectionvideos.py for every 1 minute interval.

4. For django to run the scheduler, I have overwritten the apps.py with a 
    ready function and added the class in settings.py


5. After installing the necessasry packages from requirements.txt,
    -> python manage.py makemigrations
    -> python manage.py migrate
    -> python manage.py runserver --noreload

6. You can get the results of the API from http://localhost:8000/youtubedata
